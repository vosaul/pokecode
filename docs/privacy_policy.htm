							<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
							<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
							<p>
								<b>Pokecode Sociedad Limitada</b> (hereinafter "Pokecode") is the owner of the Web Site
								<a href="http://pokecode.net/" target="_blank"> http://pokecode.net/</a>
								(hereinafter the <b>"Website"</b>) and is Responsible for the processing of the personal data of the users of
								the Website (hereinafter the <b>"Users"</b>).
							</p>
							<p>
								Through this Privacy Policy, and in compliance with Articles 12 and 13 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679
								(hereinafter <b>"GDPR"</b>) and Article 11 of the Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the Protection of
								Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights (<b>"LOPDPGDD"</b>), Pokecode informs Users using the Website
								about the processing of their personal data that may be collected through this and processed by Pokecode.
							</p>
							<h3>DATA CONTROLLER</h3>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Data controller: </b> Pokecode Sociedad Limitada</li>
								<li><b>VAT:</b> B10673663</li>
								<li><b>Registered office:</b> Carrer Davallada, Num. 1, Esc.2, Planta 1, Porta 1, 17142, Verges (Girona)</li>
								<li><b>Contact:</b> <a href="mailto:info@pokecode.net"> info@pokecode.net</a></li>
							</ul>
							<h3>DATA PROCESSED, LEGAL BASES, PURPOSES AND RETENTION PERIOD.</h3>
							<p><b>Data processed</b></p>
							<p>
								Contact information. The User can contact Pokecode by telephone and email. The data processed will be the
								Name, email, telephone number and the content of the message transmitted to Pokecode.
							</p>
							<p><b> Legal Basis </b></p>
							<p>Consent of the data subject</p>
							<p><b>Purposes</b></p>
							<p>
								To attend and respond to requests, comments, suggestions. As well as to support the User during the use of
								the Website.
							</p>
							<p><b>Retention period</b></p>
							<p>
								The personal data will be processed by Pokecode for necessary period of time to answer the question and/or
								resolve the incident indicated by the User. These data will be blocked in order to comply with Pokecode's
								legal obligations and, once this period has expired, will be definitively deleted.
							</p>
							<p>
								When using the Website, Pokecode uses the services of Plausible analysis software. This is software that,
								when tracking User data, this data is kept fully and securely encrypted. The purpose of Plausible Analytics
								is to track general traffic trends on the Website and not individual visitors. Each HTTP request sends the IP
								address and User agent to the server, so this is what they use, generating an identifier that changes daily
								using the visitor's IP address and User agent. To anonymize this data, it is passed through a hash function
								with a rotating salt. This generates a random string of letters and numbers that are used to calculate the
								number of unique visitors for the day. The IP address of the raw data and the User agent are never stored in
								the logs, databases or anywhere on Plausible analytics disk. Older salts are deleted every 24 hours to avoid
								the possibility of linking visitor information from one day to the next. In this way, no personal data is
								collected from the User while browsing our Web Site. For more information about data processing by Plausible
								Analytics, you can visit their Website at
								<a href="https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics" target="_blank">
									https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics</a
								>.
							</p>

							<h3>DATA COMMUNICATION</h3>

								Economic Area (EEA), Pokecode has entered into contracts with such entities that include such safeguards,
								including the European Commission's model clauses.
							</p>
